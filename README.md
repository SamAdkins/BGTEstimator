Simple tool to help with calculating estimations for Bryant Grout and Tile.

Takes in a .csv file with a breakdown of the labor costs for different jobs provided by Bryant Grout and Tile and uses the contents to populate the page. 
The user can then select a job type from the Job Type dropdown, enter the amount of labor to be provided for a job, and the page will calculate how much should be charged for the job. 
The user can also then use the Material Cost Information dropdown to select a type of material needed for the job and use the resulting form interface to enter the amount of that material will be needed as well as the approximate cost per unit of the material so that those costs can be added to the list of material costs.
The page calculates the total cost of all the inputted materials and labor to find the total amount that should be suggested as an estimate for a job. It also provides a breakdown of how much profit can be expected from a job by calcuating the difference between the total labor cost and the total material costs.
